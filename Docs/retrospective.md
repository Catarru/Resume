# My Retrospective - Christine Urrata

## Retrospective Key Question #1: What went well  
I’ve thoroughly enjoyed revisiting HTML after so many years, along with being introduced to CSS and Markdown. This class has sparked so many ideas I’d love to bring to life using the tools we’ve learned. In fact, something that went *too* well was having an overabundance of project plan ideas—it was hard to choose which one to start first! Given my current life situation, I’ve been refining my resume, building spreadsheets to support adjuster team management, and doing some “fall cleaning” while I’m not working, so I can reorganize my office space. I wanted to create a project management plan for all of it—but time keeps on ticking into the future!

## Retrospective Key Question #2: What went wrong  
To pick up where I left off—yes, time keeps on ticking into the future! As head of household, I’m often caught between a rock and a hard place. I’m either working seven days a week, 12 to 16 hours a day, or I’m not working due to layoffs, and the stress of finding funds for our expenses consumes my time. A major reason I returned to school is to escape this exhausting cycle and find stability through a permanent position that pays enough to reduce our overwhelming debt. Add in some unexpected family drama, surprise apartment repairs, and a broken tooth that needs a root canal—and the only time left to do schoolwork is sleep time. If only lost time could go backward… maybe I’d lose a few wrinkles and some gray hair too!

## Retrospective Key Question #3: What will we do differently next time  
I do my best to make lemonade out of lemons, and I try to keep humor in everything I do. But to be serious and pragmatic—I need to master time management in a way that fits my reality. While I’m off from school and work over the next few days, I’m separating my office from the main living area of our apartment. My children are older and not intrusive, but our cats—whom I love dearly—can be quite demanding when I’m trying to focus. Once I’ve restructured my workspace, I’ll work on fixing my sleep schedule, which should help me maintain a more consistent routine for both school and work. Continuing my education is deeply important to me, and I’m determined to earn my degree—even if it leaves me with luggage under my eyes! 😄
